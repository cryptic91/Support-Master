## How to save configurations while uninstalling the app
<details>
  <summary> 🔴 </summary>

## How to **save configurations** while uninstalling the app

Here are the couple of steps that you need to follow to save your configurations using the development store -

1 - You have to [create a development store](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PWeEiQ5z-o), and it is totally free.

2 - Install our app and select the subscription plan of the development store similar to your main store.

3 - You have to export and import the products using the [Shopify import/export system](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/import-export). You have to do this for the products that are configured with our app, not all products from your store.

4 - After that, we will transfer the configurations from your main store to the development store. You have to provide us with the myShopify URLs of both stores.

Here is an example:

   Main Store: -------------------.myshopify.com
   Dev Store: -------------------.myshopify.com

5 - Then, you can uninstall the app from your main store. When you start using the main store, you will inform us, and we will copy the configurations to your main store again.

## How to copy configurations into another store

<details>
  <summary> 🟢 </summary>

Here are the steps you need to follow to copy the product configuration to another store:

1. Export the products using this documentation: [https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/import-export](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/import-export). The product handles must match in both stores.

2. To avoid some unwanted problems, both of your stores should use the same subscription plan for our app.

After these steps, please provide us with two of the store links.

Old Store (Source Store): -------------------.myshopify.com

New Store (Destination Store): -------------------.myshopify.com

We will transfer the configurations.

## How to use a text or image using tooltip

<details>
  <summary> 🟢 </summary>
     
Hi,

Thanks for your query. There are two ways to provide a link after an element.

First, you need to use the tooltip from the Additional settings in any field. You can set the link with target=blank so that when the user clicks on it, the link destination will open in a new window, and the personalization will not be lost.

For the second,

1. Take a button choice element.
2. You can choose a label name; if not, you can leave it empty.
3. Set the link in the tooltip from Additional Settings.
4. Do not select any option set in the options field.
5. You can set it anywhere in the fields now.

Here is an example of setting up the tooltip with <a> tag.

```html
<a href="https://www.productpersonalizer.com/docs/hide-personalized-image-before-purchase" target="_blank">Click to view details</a>
```

Here is a screenshot showing where you can find the Additional settings and where you need to put the <a> tag:

## Add to cart limit = 50;

<details>
  <summary> 🔵 </summary>
     
The error occurs because Shopify introduced a feature called "Add to cart limit," which is set to 50 by default. To fix it, you need to open the Shopify **settings** > **Checkout** > **Add to cart Limit** and **disable** it.

Please watch this video tutorial: [https://www.loom.com/share/86b75a8542734d3496ef64f87e371992?sid=a0e847a3-cfb2-4f9e-bf5e-a92d478a2ed5](https://www.loom.com/share/86b75a8542734d3496ef64f87e371992?sid=a0e847a3-cfb2-4f9e-bf5e-a92d478a2ed5).

## Express checkout is not compatible with Draft order

<details>
  <summary> 🔴 </summary>

Hi **Audrey**,

Thanks for your reply.

You are using the **draft order** method, and in this method, the **express checkout** options are **not compatible**. You have to **hide** or **remove** the **express checkout** options from the **cart page**. If a user selects any of the express checkout options and proceeds to checkout, the **additional cost** will not be added to the order. Here is a screenshot showing the options for express checkout from the cart page.

[IMAGE HERE]

If you don't want to hide the **express checkout** options, you need to use the **Cart Transform method**, which is fully **compatible** with the express checkout options on the **cart page**. Here are the details of the **Cart Transform method**: [https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#1](https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#1).

## Shopify ‘Pause and build plan’ doesn’t stop charge from apps

Your store is now on the '**Pause and Build plan**'. While you use this plan, Shopify will charge you for our app because the **apps remain active**.

## Use Custom Hook for the Drawer Cart

<details>
  <summary> 🔵 </summary>

Hi, 

The drawer cart is managed by your theme, and each theme has its own method for opening it. As a third-party app, we cannot determine the exact function required to open it or provide a universal solution. 

However, our app provides a custom hook that triggers after the add-to-cart process is completed. You can share this hook with your theme developer so they can integrate it with your theme’s drawer cart function. Call the drawer cart trigger function inside this hook. 

```jsx
// Listen for the pplrAddToCartCompleted custom event
window.addEventListener('pplrAddToCartCompleted' , function(e) {
// check if the add to cart event has fired
}) 
```

For implementation details, please refer to our documentation: 

[https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-to-use-product-personalizer-custom-event-hooks](https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-to-use-product-personalizer-custom-event-hooks)

Thanks.

## Theme’s zoom-in feature is incompatible

<details>
  <summary> 🔴 </summary>

The theme’s zoom-in feature is not compatible with our app, which is why we developed the zoom functionality within the app itself. The theme uses the **<img/>** element to display images, whereas our app displays the preview image using a **<canvas/>** element. This difference in implementation is why the theme zoom feature does not reflect in our app.

## Discount takes time in Create a new product method

<details>
  <summary> 🟢 </summary>

Hi,

Thanks for sharing the detailed information and examples regarding the issue.

When using the “Create a New Product” pricing type, each time a customer clicks the Add to Cart button, our app generates a new product in Shopify with the personalized options. This newly created product takes a short time [Average delay: 10–60 seconds] to be recognized by Shopify discount collections.

> Why the Delay Happens
> 
> 
> Shopify’s backend uses asynchronous indexing.
> 
> When you create or update a product:
> 
> - Shopify queues the product for search and collection reindexing.
> - Discounts based on collections or product conditions rely on that index.

We recommend waiting a few moments before testing the discount or switching to the Draft Order method if you need the discount to apply instantly.

Here is the detail of the Draft Order pricing method: [https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#1](https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#1)

## Two methods as an alternative to personalize two products

<details>
  <summary> 🔵 </summary>

First of all, you can not directly customize two products in a single page like the why you want (1 + 1), unfortunately. Our product-personalizer app works on a single product.

However, you can add a link through our app like '__second product__' and the user can select and click on which will redirect him/her to the second product page, and the user can configure products on it. And finally, you can give a discount like buy one and get one for 100% from the Discount section. This is option-1. If you would like to do it, let us know, and we will show you step-by-step guidelines.

There can be another way, like you can use conditional logic in our app, for example, there will be two buttons like [1 product] and [2 products]. 1 product button will be pre-selected but when anyone clicks on the 2 products button, there another view will be open by conditionally when you can give different background, different customization and price but please note that, this extra view will be on the same product which means the main product will be one but user will get the chance to customize two different options separate. This is option 2. If you would like to do it, let us know, and we will show you step-by-step guidelines.

Now please let us know which one [option-1 / option-2] you would like to go. If you have any queries, always feel free to let us know.
