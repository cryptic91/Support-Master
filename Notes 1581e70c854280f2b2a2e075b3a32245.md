- **Image upload text** shows based on the users **browser language set**.
If its in Chinese then it will show in that language, if its in English then it will show in English.
    
    e.g.

- Hiding fields from the Cart and Checkout page will hide the information on **packaging slip** too.
    
    Here is the link on how to hide the fields/elements → [https://www.productpersonalizer.com/docs/hide-personalized-image-before-purchase](https://www.productpersonalizer.com/docs/hide-personalized-image-before-purchase)

- **B2B** pricing works on the **Additional Pricing = Additional product** method
    
    The native Shopify B2B pricing and catalog options doesn’t work on the Draft method. #64111
    

- **ShipStation** Fulfillment is not compatible with **Draft order**, the personalization will not go.
    
    If you want to show personalization information in the **ShipStation**, please use the additional pricing = **Additional product** method. 
    In Draft order, the personalization will not go.
    

- **Image not found** - angry merchant reply
    
    Thank you for your response. Browsers and web applications are complex and rely on cache for optimal performance. The issue you experienced arose from the removal of the image; however, the browser retained it. To resolve this, please re-upload the image with a different name, and the browser will recognize it as a new image.
    

- **Shopflo Checkout** is not compatible with **Draft order**.
    
    Using the Additional pricing = **Additional Product method** is compatible with the **Shopflo checkout**. 
    

- SKU ****explanation on **link-variant** & **Create a new product:**
    
    When you use the [Create a new product](https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#2) method, a new product will be created each time someone makes an Add-to-Cart. The SKU will be the base product SKU, and the quantity of the base product will also be reduced.
    
    Regarding the link-variant, the selected variant should be from the other products, not the base product variant. The SKU of the link variant product will be attached to the order, and the variant product inventory will also be reduced. You can review this document to learn how the link-variant works: [https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/manage-inventory-sku-by-linking-them-with-options/](https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/manage-inventory-sku-by-linking-them-with-options/).
    
    Here is an example screenshot of an order:

- In AJAX / theme ATC even, **Add-to-cart action = stay on product page** is feasible
    
    This issue occurs when using the AJAX/theme add-to-cart button. In this case, our app's add-to-cart event hook is not triggered, resulting in a blank or dummy object to the order page.
    To resolve this issue, please change the cart action = Stay on the product page and show a success message from our app settings.

- We copy **vendor** in new product but don’t copy **meta fields**
    
    When using the **Create a new product** method, a new product will be created each time anyone adds a product to the cart. In the new product, we copy the **vendor**, but we don't copy the **meta fields**. 
    

- Our app works with the most renowned page builders like **PageFly**, **GemPages**.
    
    We don’t work with the printify
    

- why **_pplr_customization_id**?
    
    Details
    
    The extra lines are used for the app's internal functionality. Without those, some of our features will not work correctly.
    
    By default, the packing slip template does not hide the line item properties starting with "_". However, you can add our code snippet to the template to hide that information. Take a look at the following documentation.
    
    [https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/display-product-options-in-packing-slip/](https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/display-product-options-in-packing-slip/)
    
    If you have changed your template from Shopify's default, the code generator might not work correctly. In that case contact the person who created the new template and ask him/her to hide the line item properties starting with "_".
    

- Additional product doesn’t work on **multiple currencies**
    
    Thanks for your patience. Additional Product is limited when using multiple currencies, especially when using features like price adjustments for markets, rounding, etc.
    
    Your current settings set the price of the additional product to $8.99, which results in failure to divide the additional price without any reminders. This causes the quantity to increase. I have explained this in the following video. Please have a look.
    
    [https://www.loom.com/share/476e7289417f473d8d58c33a4af647f2](https://www.loom.com/share/476e7289417f473d8d58c33a4af647f2)
    
    We also checked the order numbers 11943651574145 and 11954085364097. In both cases, the additional product costs 7.99 USD.
    
    However, the price may have increased recently, which has resulted in the unit price being 8.99 USD.
    
    To avoid hassle when dealing with multiple currencies, we suggest you use a draft order or the create new product method.
    

- **SKU = null** issue
    
    The variant product needs to be **active** and available in the **online store**. Please make the product active and the online store. Let us know whether it is working after activating it.
    
    Note: To hide the variant product from the online store, you can use product type = "**PPLR_HIDDEN_PRODUCT**".
    

- **Fakepath** issue on order
    
    It occurs when AJAX add-to-cart triggered. 
    
    This issue happens when the add to cart is handled by the theme AJAX instead of our app. You need to disable the AJAX add to cart from your theme or you have to use the "Button with pop up" so the issue will not happen.
    

- **Buy X Get Y discount** is not compatible with the **Draft Order + Create a new product**
    
    Buy X Get Y discount is not compatible with the Draft Order. So you will need to use the additional product for this discount.
    

- **Buy X Get Y discount** is now compatible with the Cart Transform

- Time for **discount** apply in **create a new product** method
    
    When you use the Create a new product method, there is a time taken by Shopify to add the newly created product to the collection. You can use the 'Draft order' instead of 'created a new product' method so the discount will be added instantly.
    
    **Draft Order method**: [https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#1](https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#1).

- **API hit** for fetching data and there is limitation from Shopify
    
    *ticket - #81719* 
    
    Hi **Damon**,
    
    This is another update for the earlier reply.
    
    The 'Cost per item' value is not available in the public JSON. You can see the screenshot from here: [https://prnt.sc/7t3-7hTXAlOY](https://prnt.sc/7t3-7hTXAlOY). For this reason, we need to fetch this data, and as a result, we need to hit the API. But there is a limit from Shopify regarding this API hit, which might make the solution more risky. If the API hit gets blocked, the add-to-cart will not happen. There can be more complexity, and frequent issues can arise as well. This is why we can't take the data in the newly created product, and we suggested you alternative options, 'Additional Product method'. We also have the Draft order method.
    
    **Additional Product method**: [https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#3](https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#3).
    
    **Draft Order method**: [https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#1](https://productpersonalizer.com/docs/how-options-with-costs-are-displayed-in-the-cart-checkout/#1).

- **Single quotation** doesn’t work for the font
    
    ![image.png](Notes/image%204.png)
    

- **Draft Order** is suitable with **multi-currency**
    
    Draft order is much more suitable for multi-currency than the Additional product method.

- Essential upsell creates two products in the cart and reloading the cart, deletes the variants coming from link-variant
    
    Thanks for the access. We can see the issue is coming from the Upsell app that you're using in the product page. When user personalize the product and add the upsell and click on the add to cart button then two of the main products gets added + one upsell product gets added to the cart.
    
    When user see double product/duplicate product then they delete the first product from the cart and reload the page and do the checkout and that is when the issue appears because the main product where the link variant was already removed.
    
    To get it fixed, you need to
    
    **disable the upsell app on the producrt page**
    
    so the issue will be fixed. We have disabled the upsell app in the browser and checked it and it is working fine. The upsell app name is
    
    **"Essential upsell"**
    
    Please let us know if you have any other questions.
    

- how to use the custom emoji like WOFF format in pplr input
    
    You need to use the same font file (.WOFF) where the custom emoji will be in the extra keyboard. Only at that time, the emoji will appear in the text input field and the live preview. But when you use multiple fonts, if anyone chooses a font file that doesn't include the emoji, that emoji will not work in the input field or live preview.

- Why the delay for create a new product method??
    
    The issue you’re experiencing with the Create New Product method is due to recent Shopify updates. We use this method to pass our app’s pricing to the checkout and order, but after the update it started causing these issues. Although we’ve applied a temporary delay-based fix, the behavior is affected by the platform changes.
    
    To resolve this issue, we kindly recommend disabling the Create New Product method on your products and using only the Cart Transform method. Shopify introduced Cart Transform recently, and it is the most up-to-date and refined pricing approach.
    
    We also noticed that the issue you had earlier occurred when both the Create New Product method and Cart Transform were enabled at the same time, which is not a recommended setup and can lead to conflicts.
    
    If you’d like, we can disable the Create New Product method across all products using a single line of JavaScript. Most of our merchants are successfully using the Cart Transform method alone, without create new product setup and it’s working as expected. For this reason, we strongly recommend this configuration.
    

- Using bundle product. When goes to checkout it shows out of stock.
    
    ![image.png](Notes/image%205.png)
    
    Thank you for your patience while we looked into the issue. This is expected Shopify behavior. All bundle variants do have inventory, but when an order is placed using our "Create a new product" method, our app duplicates the main product. Since this duplicated product is newly created, Shopify initializes it with zero inventory by default. Inventory is still deducted correctly from the bundle component products.
    
    You can learn more about how Shopify handles bundle inventory here:
    
    [https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/bundles/eligibility-and-considerations](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/products/bundles/eligibility-and-considerations?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
    
    To avoid this issue, we suggest disabling the "Create a new product" method and using the Draft Order method instead.
